# Week 3 

## Ideation
This week, I built an interactive map that displays weather information for the location clicked by the user. The map provides users with real-time weather information for specific locations on a world map.

## Design & Wireframes
Users can check the weather information by clicking on the map and instantly viewing weather updates for specific locations. The cards incorporate visual elements GIFs to depict weather conditions. I started by collecting GIFs showing various weather conditions.

## Process 
The coding process for creating an interactive weather map starts by setting up the Google Maps API to display the world map. Mouse click events on the map are captured to fetch latitude and longitude coordinates for the clicked spot. These coordinates are then used to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API, storing details like temperature and weather conditions. Once the weather data is received, it's presented to the user, including specific information about the temperature and weather conditions. Additionally, corresponding GIFs are played based on the weather conditions displayed on the weather card.
